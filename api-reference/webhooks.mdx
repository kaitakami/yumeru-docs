<Note>
  Webhooks are only available for paid customers. Make sure you have the right access level before implementing webhooks.
</Note>

## Overview

Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications when events occur in your account. We'll send HTTP POST requests to your configured endpoint with event data whenever a call is started, ended, or analyzed.

## Event Types

We send three types of webhook events:

- `call_started` - Triggered when a call begins
- `call_ended` - Triggered when a call completes
- `call_analyzed` - Triggered when our AI finishes analyzing the call

## Environments

Webhooks are available in two environments:

- **Production** - Real campaign calls
- **Testing** - Test calls made through dashboard 

<Warning>
  Test calls made through the dashboard are not stored in our system. Make sure to store the webhook data if you need to reference it later.
</Warning>

## Call Types

### Campaign Calls
Regular calls made through your campaigns include campaign-specific fields like `campaign_id` and `target_id`. These calls are stored in our system for tracking and analytics.

### Test Calls
Calls made through the web interface for testing purposes. These omit campaign-specific fields and can be identified by their `web_` prefix in the `call.id`.

## Security

### Webhook Signatures

All webhook requests include a signature in the `X-Yumeru-Signature` header. You should verify this signature to ensure the webhook came from Yumeru:

```typescript
import crypto from 'crypto';

function verifySignature(payload: unknown, signature: string, secret: string): boolean {
  const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret);
  hmac.update(JSON.stringify(payload));
  const expectedSignature = hmac.digest('hex');
  
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(signature),
    Buffer.from(expectedSignature)
  );
}
```

### Webhook Secrets
- Secrets are prefixed with `whsec_` and are base64url encoded
- Store your webhook secret securely

## Event Structure

### Common Fields
All webhook events include these base fields:

```typescript
interface YumeruWebhookEvent {
  event: "call_started" | "call_ended" | "call_analyzed";
  call: {
    id: string;
    type: "web_call" | "phone_call";
    agent_id: string;
    campaign_id?: number;
    target_id?: number;
    dynamic_variables: Record<string, string>;
    status: string;
    start_timestamp: number;
    end_timestamp?: number;
    duration_ms?: number;
    total_duration_seconds?: number;
    recording_url?: string;
    disconnection_reason?: string;
    from_number: string;
    to_number: string;
    direction: "inbound" | "outbound";
    transcript?: string;
    transcript_object?: Array<{
      role: "agent" | "user";
      content: string;
      words: Array<{
        word: string;
        start: number;
        end: number;
      }>;
      metadata?: {
        response_id: number;
      };
    }>;
    call_analysis?: {
      call_summary: string;
      in_voicemail: boolean;
      user_sentiment: string;
      call_successful: boolean;
      custom_analysis_data: Record<string, unknown>;
    };
  };
}
```

### Example: Campaign Call

    "from_number": "+12185856761",
    "to_number": "+528443804581",
    "direction": "outbound",
    "transcript": "Full conversation transcript...",
    "transcript_object": [
      {
        "role": "agent",
        "content": "Hello, this is...",
        "words": [
          {
            "word": "Hello",
            "start": 0.5,
            "end": 0.9
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "call_analysis": {
      "call_summary": "The call was successful...",
      "in_voicemail": false,
      "user_sentiment": "positive",
      "call_successful": true,
      "custom_analysis_data": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### Example: Test Call

```json
{
  "event": "call_ended",
  "call": {
    "id": "web_87a50aa10731e2b1df4443a8007",
    "type": "web_call",
    "agent_id": "1234",
    "dynamic_variables": {
      "name": "Sara (Test)",
      "current_date": "Monday, February 3, 2025"
    },
    "status": "ended",
    "start_timestamp": 1738537527378,
    "end_timestamp": 1738537551414,

    "from_number": "+12185856761",
    "to_number": "+528443804581",
    "direction": "outbound",
    "transcript": "Full conversation transcript..."
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Security
- Always verify webhook signatures using your webhook secret
- Only accept webhooks over HTTPS
- Rotate webhook secrets periodically
- Store webhook secrets securely, never in code

### Implementation
- Process webhooks asynchronously
- Return a 2xx status code quickly to acknowledge receipt
- Implement retry logic for failed webhook deliveries
- Store raw webhook payloads for debugging
- Handle duplicate deliveries (use `call.id` for idempotency)
- Check `call.id` prefix to differentiate test/campaign calls & call types (web_call will be a test call)
- Don't assume campaign fields will be present

### Error Handling
- Set up monitoring for webhook processing
- Log failed webhook deliveries
- Alert on repeated failures
- Implement dead letter queues for failed webhooks
- Handle timeouts gracefully
